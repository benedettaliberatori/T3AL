> **Abstract:** 

Zero-Shot Temporal Action Localization (ZS-TAL) seeks
to identify and locate actions in untrimmed videos unseen
during training. Existing ZS-TAL methods involve fine-
tuning a model on a large amount of annotated training
data. While effective, training-based ZS-TAL approaches as-
sume the availability of labeled data for supervised learning,
which can be impractical in some applications. Furthermore,
the training process naturally induces a domain bias into the
learned model, which may adversely affect the modelâ€™s gen-
eralization ability to arbitrary videos. These considerations
prompt us to approach the ZS-TAL problem from a radically
novel perspective, relaxing the requirement for training data.
To this aim, we introduce a novel method that performs Test-
Time adaptation for Temporal Action Localization (T<sup>3</sup>AL).
In a nutshell, T<sup>3</sup>AL adapts a pre-trained Vision and Lan-
guage Model (VLM) at inference time on a sample basis.
T<sup>3</sup>AL operates in three steps. First, a video-level pseudo-
label of the action category is computed by aggregating
information from the entire video. Then, action localization
is performed adopting a novel procedure inspired by self-
supervised learning. Finally, frame-level textual descriptions
extracted with a state-of-the-art captioning model are em-
ployed for refining the action region proposals. We validate
the effectiveness of T<sup>3</sup>AL by conducting experiments on the
THUMOS14 and the ActivityNet-v1.3 datasets. Our results
demonstrate that T 3 AL significantly outperforms zero-shot
baselines based on state-of-the-art VLMs, confirming the
benefit of a test-time adaptation approach. 



# Setup

We recommend the use of a Linux machine with CUDA compatible GPUs. We provide a Conda environment to configure the required libraries.

Clone the repo with:

```bash
git clone ...
cd T3AL
```

## Conda

The environment can be installed and activated with:

```bash
conda create --name t3al python=3.8
conda activate t3al
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


# Preparing Datasets
We recommend to use pre-extracted CoCa features to accelerate inference. Please download the extracted features for THUMOS14 and ActivityNet datasets from links below: 

## Pre-extracted Features

# Evaluation

The method can be evaluated on the `dataset` of interest and selecting the `split` and `setting`, by running the following bash script:

```bash
python src/train.py experiment=tt_<dataset_name> data=<dataset_name> model.video_path=</path/to/data/> model.split=<split> model.setting=<setting> data.nsplit=0 exp_name=<exp_name>
```

We provide config files for the main method `tt_<dataset_name>`, the training free baseline `tf_<dataset_name>` and the baselines `baseline`.
